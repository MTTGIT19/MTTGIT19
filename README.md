## *Aviation nerd. Tinkerer. Veteran*   
Current shenanigans:
- Check out my new website: https://cyberskies.org
  - I'll be writing about offensive cybersecurity certs, how to stay motivated while learning, and other random topics. 
- HackTheBox pro labs and hands-on certifications.
- Taking excessive notes of all the things (https://obsidian.md :+1:)
- Competitive cyber tournaments aka group *Capture The Flag* events.

## üêç Original scripts / code projects  
Self taught Python 'programmer'. Really I just enjoy writing scripts that automate the boring stuff and make my job (and others) more efficient.
