## Military veteran turned Cybersecurity professional
Take a look around or feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I post anything from scripts to personal work or Master's projects. 

I've been building computers since I was little but I'm interested in most things IT. Here's a bit of what I'm currently working on:  
- Wrapping up my masters degree (Info Sec)
- Hands-on-keyboard prep for the OSCP. 
- Taking excessive notes of all the things (https://obsidian.md :+1:)
- Malware analysis and breaking my computer.
