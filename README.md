Take a look around or feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I post anything from scripts to personal work or Master's projects. 

I've been building computers since I was little but I'm interested in most things IT. Here's a bit of what I'm currently working on:
- Preparing for a hands-on hacking cert. Currently leaning towards the eJPT.
- Taking excessive notes of all the things (https://obsidian.md :+1:)
- Writing Python scripts to make my life easier.
- Malware analysis and breaking my computer.
