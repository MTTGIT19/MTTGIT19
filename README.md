## Military veteran turned Cybersecurity professional
Take a look around or feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I post anything from Python scripts to infographics or master's projects. <br>
I've been building computers since I was little but I'm interested in most things IT. Here's a bit of what I'm currently working on:<br/>
- Wrapping up my masters degree (Information Security)
- Hands-on-keyboard prep for the OSCP. 
- Taking excessive notes of all the things (https://obsidian.md :+1:)
- Competitive cyber tournaments aka *Capture The Flag* events.
