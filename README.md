## Military veteran turned Cybersecurity professional
Take a look around or contact me via LinkedIn. I post anything from personnal work to masters projects. 

I've been building computers since I was little but I'm interested in most things IT. Here's a bit of what I'm currently working on:
- Preparing for the OSCP. Lots of hands-on penetration testing and report writing (Obsidian is great for note taking). 
- Writing Python scripts to make my life easier.
- Malware analysis and breaking my computer.
